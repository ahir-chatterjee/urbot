# urbot
A simple discord bot that utilizes different scripts to run commands. Created to help run the UT League of Legends Competitive discord server.

Update 6/16/20: this repository will be discontinued. Urbot utilizes many functions from the league-analytics repository, and will instead be merged into that. There will be no further updates for Urbot here, but it will continue to see updates to the code base in it's new home.
